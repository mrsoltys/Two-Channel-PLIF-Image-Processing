This is me trying to use GitHub to do version control on my matlab code.

The code is good for doing image processing on two-channel PLIF data, as presented in Soltys and Crimaldi 2011 (experiments in fluids).  

The code requires matlab's image processing toolbox as well as the camera calibration toolbox for matlab, which can be downloaded here:
